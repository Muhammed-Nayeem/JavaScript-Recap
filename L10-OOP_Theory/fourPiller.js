//OOP is just a theory which is stand on main four pillars:
//i) Abstraction -> Implementation hiding and hiding unnecessary implementation and complexity from user;
//ii) Encapsulation -> Properties and Method are bind in an object and that data work as one unit;
//iii) Inheritance -> Inheritance means dragged the properties and methods from other classes and make a hierearchy;
//iv) Polymorphism -> Polymorphism means change the object face for every creation of object;
