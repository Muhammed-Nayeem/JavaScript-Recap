//What is Synchronous Programming?
:- Existing or Occurring at the same time - In details, Synchronous programming means that you can execute one thing at a time.
- We know in Js the code is execute line by line, this is the Synchronous system;
:example of Synchronous code:
let a = "Synchronous Code";
console.log(a);

let b = "This is Line two";
console.log(b);

let result = getDataFromStorage(DB-url);
if (result.response) {
  console.log("Data Collected!");
} else {
  console.log("Data Not Found!");
}

//What is Asynchronous Programming?
:- Not existing or occurring at the same time - In details, Asynchronous programming means that you can execute multiple thing at a time and you don't have to finish the current execute thing to move on to the next one.

:example of Asynchronous code:
let a = "Synchronous Code";
console.log(a);

let b = "This is Line two";
console.log(b);

let result = getDataFromStorage(DB-url);
if (result.response) {
  console.log("Data Collected!");
} else {
  console.log("Data Not Found!");
}
