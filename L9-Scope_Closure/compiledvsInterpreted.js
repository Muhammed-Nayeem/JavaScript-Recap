//Interpreted: In this process the whole code is execute line by line, but it is very lengthy and slow process; but also there is a easiest way for debugging in code.

//Compiled: First the whole code runs for generating build the exe file where the machine code generate and at time the whole code execute, it's first but there is a problem with debugging in code.

//Compared to both mechanism: Both mechanism have the advantages and disadvantages and that's why the JIT compiler is invention by using both mechanism. Which is more fast and flexible way to debugging code.
